I realized that out of all the software calculators I've used, is better than most of them in terms of usability. I wanted to create a simple calculator that has all the stuff I need but none of the extra features present in programming languages that I don't. Matlab and Mathematica are great but proprietary. `sed` and `awk` were designed for text processing. `bc` comes close, but it's a little terse for my taste - I'd rather have sin() than s(), it's not like I'm using a teletype.
